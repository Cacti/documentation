# Plugin Guidelines

## Overview

This section will help the Cacti plugin developer structure their plugins.
However, the best way to create a plugin is to borrow someone elses.  There
are Cacti plugin examples on [Cactis GitHub page](https://github.com/Cacti) and
you can find them all over GitHub just by searching.

## Plugin Creation

Use the following guidelines for creating your first plugin.

## Plugin Namespaces

All plugins must use namespace isolation either through Classes, or using
the plugin name in their functions.  This prevents name space collisions.

An example plugin is provided here [Example Plugin](resources/example.tgz).

## Publishing Your Plugin

GitHub is the best place to publish your plugins.  Learn to use it.
