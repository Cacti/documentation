This section will describe **Graph** management in Cacti.

Cacti features a way to view the graphs per device via the console this allows 
the administrator to view the graphs that are attached to a specific device you 
can also search by type of graph shown below we search for graphs that are

### Modifying the graph template

Cacti allows you to change many aspects of the graph template its self you 
can change parameters such the title of the graph as well the size of the graphs 
etc. These changes will be pushed to the graph template its self so others 
devices using the template will also be updated.
