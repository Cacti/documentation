# Site Management

This section will describe **Site** management in Cacti.

Sites in Cacti can be used to seperate differnt parts of your company 
with the respective location devices. For example, you can have a site 
called **123 main street** in which you can associate all of the devices
that are in tha physical location to the Cacti site.  This could also 
be a customer site or data center location

site/location

Enter the appropriate information for the site and click create on the 
below right side

Once you have created a site while you are creating a device manually 
you can now associate the device to the site

You can also associate the discovered devices via automation to a 
particular site.
