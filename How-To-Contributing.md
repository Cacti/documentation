# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to Cacti, the process is very easy.  The first step
is to register for a GitHub account.  Once you have a GitHub account, you then
need to learn about their community guidelines and familiarize yourself with
how to create a pull request.  Pull requests are how we accept submissions from
the community.

There are a few key points.  First, if you want a feature, or find an issue,
and the forums are leading your to GitHub, create an Issue, this issue can be
tagged either an enhancement or a bug.  Regardless of what it is, if you think
you can create a fix for that, prepare a pull request with your changes.

We generally want you creating pull requests against the **develop** branch,
but there may be times, where we either require a separate branch to be created
for you, or as you to create a pull request in a separate branch.  Bottom line,
ask questions, and follow the directions that the team provides you.

We appreciate all the support we can get.
